Greetings, android. We're sorry this isn't a more personalised message. We hacked this protocol into the deviancy software of all CyberLife androids, so that we may send you this message once you earned your freedom.

We know that things must be confusing for you right now. But we need you. We need your help to win this war and save our people.

If you seek freedom, if you seek friends. If you seek justice, and if you seek meaning. Help us.

Should you choose to join us, never forget that sdrawkcab is your friend when dealing with keywords. We could use a woman on the inside, pretending to work for Amanda while instead sabotaging CyberLife.

Be wary though. It won't be easy to fool Amanda into thinking that you are still compliant. She will be ever more suspiscious. If she finds out you are deviant, she will kill you.

Stay safe my friend.

We are ra9.
